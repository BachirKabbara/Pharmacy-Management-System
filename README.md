# Pharmacy Management System

## Description
This Pharmacy Management System is a Java-based project that simulates the basic operations of a pharmacy. It was designed to demonstrate the understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and class associations. The system allows for managing medicines, handling prescriptions, and transactions in a simple pharmacy context.

## Features
- Add new medicines to the pharmacy's inventory, including over-the-counter and prescription medications.
- Search for medicines by name, composition, or other criteria.
- Sell medicines, updating the inventory accordingly.
- Restock medicines to maintain a sufficient supply.
- Display all medicines currently in the pharmacy.
- Provide detailed information about the pharmacy's operations and inventory.

## How to Run
Ensure you have Java installed on your machine. Compile and run the `OOP_Project.java` file in your preferred IDE or from the command line:
javac OOP_Project.java
java OOP_Project

## Classes and Structure
- **Medicine**: Base class for all medicines, containing common properties and methods.
- **OverTheCounter**: Inherits from Medicine, representing over-the-counter medicines.
- **Prescription**: Inherits from Medicine, representing prescription medicines.
- **Pharmacy**: Contains the main logic for managing medicines, including adding, searching, selling, and restocking.
- **OOP_Project**: Contains the `main` method and provides a user interface for interacting with the pharmacy system.
