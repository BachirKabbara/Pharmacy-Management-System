# Pharmacy-Management-System
This Pharmacy Management System is a project that simulates the basic operations of a pharmacy. It was designed to demonstrate the understanding concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and class associations. The system allows for managing medicines, handling prescriptions, and transactions in a simple pharmacy context.
