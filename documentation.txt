Pharmacy Management System Documentation
========================================

Overview:
---------
The Pharmacy Management System is a Java-based application designed to simulate the workings of a pharmacy. It manages the inventory of medicines, including over-the-counter and prescription drugs, and allows for transactions such as selling and restocking medicines.

Classes:
--------
1. Medicine:
   - Description: Represents a generic medicine with attributes like name, composition, dose, price, and quantity.
   - Attributes:
     - String name: The name of the medicine.
     - String composition: The composition of the medicine.
     - int dose: The dosage in milligrams.
     - double price: The price per unit.
     - int quantity: The available quantity in stock.
   - Methods: Constructors, getters, setters, toString, equals.

2. OverTheCounter (extends Medicine):
   - Description: Represents over-the-counter medicines with an additional attribute for minimum age.
   - Additional Attribute:
     - int minAge: The minimum age required to purchase the medicine.
   - Methods: Constructors, setter and getter for minAge, and an overridden toString method.

3. Prescription (extends Medicine):
   - Description: Represents prescription medicines with an additional attribute for doctor specialization.
   - Additional Attribute:
     - String doctorSpecialization: The specialization of the doctor who prescribed the medicine.
   - Methods: Constructors, setter and getter for doctorSpecialization, and an overridden toString method.

4. Pharmacy:
   - Description: Manages the inventory and operations of the pharmacy, including adding, searching, selling, and restocking medicines.
   - Attributes: name, array of Medicines, counters for over-the-counter and prescription quantities, etc.
   - Methods: Constructors, setters and getters, addMedicine, raisePrices, searchByName, searchByComposition, sellMedicine, restock, toString.

5. OOP_Project (Main Class):
   - Description: Contains the main method and provides a user interface for interacting with the pharmacy system.
   - Functionality: Provides a menu-driven interface to interact with the Pharmacy class and perform operations like adding medicines, searching, selling, restocking, and displaying information.

Usage:
------
1. Compiling and Running:
   - Compile the Java files using `javac` and then run the `OOP_Project` class.
   - Example commands:
     ```
     javac OOP_Project.java
     java OOP_Project
     ```

2. Interacting with the System:
   - Follow the prompts in the console to interact with the system.
   - Choose the appropriate option from the menu to add medicines, search, sell, restock, and view information.
